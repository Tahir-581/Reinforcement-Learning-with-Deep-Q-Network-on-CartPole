# Reinforcement Learning with Deep Q-Networks on CartPole  

This project demonstrates how to train a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to solve the **CartPole-v1** environment using **TensorFlow** and **OpenAI Gym**. The agent learns to balance a pole on a moving cart by optimizing its policy through experience replay.  

## **Requirements**  

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  

```bash
pip install gym numpy tensorflow
